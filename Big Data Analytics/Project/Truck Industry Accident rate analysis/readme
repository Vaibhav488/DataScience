Introduction   
1. Application of Big Data - Hadoop  
2. Hadoop File Systems – HDFS 
3. Data Extraction, loading and transformation – ETL 
4. Reporting and Analytics with Hadoop and Excel 
 
Objective: 
By using the provided HDP tools and techniques, the students will process the data to create their own analytics reports and create a visual presentation that will benefit decision-makers. This virtual lab-based course will use truck fleet data to refine and analyse trucking movement in order to meet the organizational goal of better understanding risk. The use case involves geographic data, vehicles, average mileage, gas consumption, events, risk factors, and other supporting information. Each truck has been equipped to with devices to log location and event data. These events are streamed back to a datacentre where students will process the data and revise truck movements to increase safety.
